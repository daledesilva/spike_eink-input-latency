# E-ink Input Latency Spike

This repository contains experimental code to test and measure how input latency works while drawing strokes in e-ink displays. The goal is to understand latency, relationship, and completeness of sequential points in a drawn stroke to enable optimisation of pen input in both standard screen mode and Boox handwriting captured mode.
